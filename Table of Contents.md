## Prose (?) Vault Data

### 📖 [[README]]
Primary entry point for understanding the vault’s structure, methodology, and LLM-assisted workflows. Explains Map of Content usage, glossary conventions, and the purpose of the system as a whole.
### 📝 [[MoC - Handwritten|Handwritten]]
My handwritten works.
### 🪽 [[MoC - Autogénesis|Autogénesis]]
Quadrant based, self built "Castle of Glass :P" to explore & cartograph my brain. Which is me. Which is my brain. Weird loop. 
### ⚙️ [[MoC - Diátaxis|Diátaxis]]
Technical Writing of my personal study following the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework–post `07/31/2025`. Here's [[copilot-instructions.md#Diátaxis|copilot instructions for diátaxis]] in the form of a system prompt for an agentic LLM. Assuming I'm disciplined enough to always write docs. It's becoming more of a habit.
### 🗝️ [[MoC - Masterkey|Masterkey]]
Legend of Zelda Masterkey, normally unlocks the dungeon's boss room. Here it signals a waypoint. Something important to remember. I should review these often, as I view them as the keys to finding meaning.

## Meta Vault Data

### 🏷️ [[ALL TAGS]]
This is a full list of every tag used in the repo. Eventually we need to get into embedding and consolidating tags, but for now, the bloat isn't too bad. Read up on how I plan to consolidate tags: [[Tag Consolidation via Semantic Proximity and Dictionary Compression 1]]. <- Couple this with the Tag Wrangler Obsidian plugin, and I think we have a winner?? Need to investigate.
### ✅ [[MoC - TODO|TODO]]
My TODO list. This is my actionable items to complete. This is how I remember what notes need to be refined or completed, or other projects I'm working on. The tag `#todo`, will send a notification to the TODO MoC.
### 🔢 [[MoC - Bases|Bases]]
Obsidian supported `*.base` files for view database like tables of vault content. Lot's of introspection of the structure of this vault becomes available here.
