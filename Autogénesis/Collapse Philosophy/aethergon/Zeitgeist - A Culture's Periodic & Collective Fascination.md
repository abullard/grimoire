The line you quoted — _“Man finds himself completely enraptured by whatever direction society manifests…”_ — does **not** appear in JP Jacobsen’s _The Plague of Bergamo_. That sounds more like a paraphrase or an interpretive gloss than a direct quotation. Jacobsen is more poetic and symbolic in tone, whereas your line feels sociological and reflective of zeitgeist theory (like Ortega y Gasset or even early cultural critics).

But the **phenomenon you’re describing** is real: the idea that cultural products (literature, art, film) mirror the subconscious yearnings of an era. This is linked to **Zeitgeist** (📘 _“spirit of the time”_), cultural determinism, and even Jungian collective unconscious. Let’s map a few historical examples:

---

#### **1. The Romantic Era (late 18th – mid 19th century)**

**Zeitgeist**: Disillusionment with Enlightenment rationality and Industrial Revolution progress.  
**Cultural Obsession**: _Escape into nature, sublime experiences, personal passion._

- Think **Wordsworth’s lakes**, **Shelley’s storms**, and **Caspar David Friedrich’s lonely wanderers**.
- Underneath: A reaction against mechanized society and urban alienation.

---

#### **2. The Victorian Gothic Revival (mid-late 19th century)**

**Zeitgeist**: Rapid industrialization → fear of moral decay, science unsettling faith.  
**Cultural Obsession**: _Haunted castles, vampires, the uncanny._

- **Dracula**, **Frankenstein**, Gothic cathedrals in art & architecture.
- Underneath: Society wrestling with Darwin, colonial guilt, and repressed sexuality.

---

#### **3. The Interwar Years (1918–1939)**

**Zeitgeist**: Trauma from WWI, distrust in authority, craving new forms.  
**Cultural Obsession**: _Modernism, surrealism, jazz, existentialism._

- **Hemingway’s disillusioned wanderers**, **Picasso’s abstractions**, **T.S. Eliot’s fragmented poetry**.
- Underneath: A feeling that the old world had collapsed → embrace of chaos and experimentation.

---

#### **4. Post-WWII & 1950s Consumer Boom**

**Zeitgeist**: Relief + prosperity after horror → conformity + nuclear anxiety.  
**Cultural Obsession**: _Suburban dream, sci-fi monsters, and paranoia thrillers._

- Think **Invasion of the Body Snatchers**, **Leave It to Beaver**, **advertising utopia**.
- Underneath: Fear of communism and loss of individuality in mass culture.

---

#### **5. 1960s Counterculture**

**Zeitgeist**: Rebellion against authority, civil rights, Vietnam backlash.  
**Cultural Obsession**: _Sex, drugs, and rock ’n’ roll, communes, psychedelia._

- Music as liberation (**Beatles**, **Woodstock**), literature (**Kerouac**), film (**Easy Rider**).
- Underneath: A revolt against postwar conformity, yearning for authenticity.

---

#### **6. Early 2000s (your example)**

**Zeitgeist**: Post-Cold War optimism fading, early internet acceleration, 9/11 anxiety.  
**Cultural Obsession**: _Escaping the office, digital freedom, and identity search._

- **The Matrix**, **Fight Club**, **Office Space**, **American Beauty**.
- Underneath: Angst about meaningless corporate life, yearning for self-actualization.

---

#### **7. Today (2020s)**

**Zeitgeist**: Digital saturation, climate dread, AI uncertainty.  
**Cultural Obsession**: _Apocalyptic aesthetics, cozy nostalgia, multiverse chaos._

- **Everything Everywhere All at Once**, **cozy gaming (Stardew Valley)**, **Barbenheimer cultural whiplash**.
- Underneath: Overwhelmed by choice, searching for grounding in fragmented realities.

---

### **Patterns You’re Touching On**

Each era has **dominant anxieties or dreams**, and culture becomes an unconscious mirror. Sometimes this is escapist (Romanticism), sometimes hyperreal (postmodernism). The subconscious leans into what feels lacking: **mechanization → nature**, **conformity → rebellion**, **meaninglessness → mythic escape**.

---

👉 Do you want me to **map a full timeline of these subconscious cultural waves from ancient times to now** (including things like Greek tragedy, Renaissance humanism, postwar existentialism, cyberpunk, etc.) — or should we **zoom in on modern phenomena (20th–21st century) and their psychological roots**?
