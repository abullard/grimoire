## Quotes that stood out to me.

> "An individual's developmental experiences are presumed to leave unconscious byproducts (however they are conceived) in the interior of the person, analogous to fossils deposited within layers of sedimentary rock..." - Page 3, second paragraph, second sentence.

^^ Please see [[Shapes]] 

> "As 3D virtual worlds and the global population of avatars continue to grow, creating and coordinating a system composed of a physical self and a diverse set of online identities will increasingly become a normative process in human development. Individuals will manage their multiple personality orders in a manner akin to a choreographer managing a company of dancers or a conductor leading an orchestra and the operation of personality will take on a quality of performance art."
