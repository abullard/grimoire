> The system is collapsing on itself because capitalism so atomized and hoisted the individual to heights of anti-community, that most believe they're the only existence they need to steward. They only care for their perception, because they're not learned enough to do anything but monkey around. This individual first, I'm the only one that matters mentality lead to the post truth era, and now people only believe what they feel, which is further destroying what remains. Add in corrupt people taking advantage of this subjective piece, and you have the boiling pan we're in now. What do you think? what am I missing?

Ah, Okizame, this is a sharp and painful diagnosis — and you’re circling the heart of something that many refuse to name plainly: that liberal capitalism, for all its material and political gains, sowed the seeds of its own unraveling by turning community into a market and the self into a product.

You’ve outlined the chain:

> Atomization → solipsistic 📘 _solipsistic_: the belief that only one’s own mind is sure to exist → post-truth → exploitation of subjectivity → collapse.

You’re not wrong. But there are a few layers worth tempering, complicating, and extending — because the story is messier than “capitalism bad → people dumb → collapse.”

## 🌱 **1. Yes: atomization is a feature, not a bug**

Capitalism and modernity thrive on breaking up bonds of kinship, tradition, and even geography to create free, mobile, consuming individuals. Marx called this _the dissolution of all fixed relations_. By making the self “sovereign” and every other tie voluntary (or commodified), you create a culture of people who see others not as kin but as competition — or worse, irrelevant.

People then over-invest in their image, because “perception” becomes their only currency in the social marketplace. That’s not stupidity so much as desperation in a rigged game.

So yes — this is a world where myopic 📘 _myopic_: short-sighted _self-stewardship_ replaces collective stewardship. And yes, it makes people vulnerable to lies that flatter their feelings over hard truths.

## 🌱 **2. But: individualism isn’t the only culprit**

It’s easy (and tempting) to say “capitalist individualism ruined everything.” But remember:

- Humans have _always_ been prone to tribalism and subjective reality, even in premodern societies. (“My tribe’s gods are true, yours are false.”)
- The _technological acceleration_ — social media, algorithms, mass surveillance — supercharged these tendencies beyond what liberal or socialist theorists of the 19th/20th centuries imagined.
- Political actors and bad-faith opportunists (Trump, Putin, Bolsonaro, Cambridge Analytica, etc.) didn’t just exploit subjectivity — they weaponized it at scale using tools no peasant or worker of 1848 could dream of.

So it’s not just the ideology of individualism — it’s also the information ecosystem that makes disinformation profitable, viral, and sticky.

## 🌱 **3. What’s missing: why people cling to feelings**

The post-truth era didn’t emerge because everyone became narcissists overnight. It emerged because:

- Truth became _too painful, too complex, and too slow_ compared to emotional narratives.
- Institutions that used to anchor truth (church, press, universities) lost credibility — often deservedly — but nothing filled the void.
- Many people experience modern life as precarious, lonely, and humiliating. Believing a comforting lie (that you’re secretly part of the righteous and everyone else is corrupt) is a coping mechanism.

Put simply: the conditions that produce post-truth are structural, not just moral failure. That’s uncomfortable, because it means fixing it isn’t just “telling people to stop being stupid.” It’s rebuilding trust, security, and shared meaning.

---

## 🪞 **Reality check: can this be reversed?**

Possibly. But the longer the feedback loops of distrust and narcissism run, the harder it is. As Hannah Arendt warned: once people lose the distinction between truth and lies, they don’t care what’s true — only what feels good, or what humiliates their enemies.

---

## 🪷 **A question back to you:**

What do you think is more urgent —  
✅ to strengthen individuals to resist the pull of comforting lies, or  
✅ to rebuild collective institutions and culture that make truth feel like something worth having?

Because either way, it’s not just about critique — it’s about choosing where to dig.

You’re right about the boiling pan. But even in boiling water you can sometimes turn down the heat and rescue what’s left. The real debate is: how much do you save, and how much do you let go?

If you want, I can sketch what a roadmap for each approach — individual or institutional — might look like.

What are you feeling? Where does your impulse lean?
