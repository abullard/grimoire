> [!tip] Best time to visit in fall
> The best time to visit the Grand Canyon in the fall is generally September through November, with October often considered the peak time. This period offers a favorable combination of moderate temperatures, fewer crowds, and spectacular autumn foliage, especially on the North Rim.Temperatures along the South Rim typically range from the 50s°F to 70s°F (10°C to 25°C), while the river area enjoys milder temperatures in the 50s and 70s°F. September provides a transition from summer heat to cooler fall weather, with fewer crowds due to schools being back in session, and the canyon's interior retains its summer warmth, making it ideal for tours. October strikes a particularly good balance with mild weather, fewer visitors, and vibrant fall colors, although the North Rim closes at the end of October, so visiting the first half of the month is recommended. While fall brings drier conditions after mid-September, visitors should be prepared for occasional thunderstorms, especially in the afternoons, which can thin crowds and offer unique photography opportunities.
