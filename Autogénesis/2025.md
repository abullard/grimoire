title: Just some thoughts
content: 
- Copilot LLM RAG on this vault is extremely powerful. The insight is that the tools that allow reflection on the vault itself introduce emergent complexity. 
- Allow copilot to automatically output files with `#todo`s in them? An inbox is an event emitter...
- Bases are a reflection operation. The system knows what it's composed of. We just need to seed it with the right context.
- Needs a lot of work. Just some curosry thoughts.

title: Copilot Obsidian!?
content: 
- Found out you can hook up an LLM to obsidian, right in the app. It has the entire vault as context to work with. This is a game changer. Curious how much it costs...

title: Found Map of Content Organization
content: 
- No need to worry about how organized my folder structure is. I can just make a Map of Contents (MoC) for anything. It works as a drill-in from more abstract concepts to more concrete, the farther in you go. Start with [[MoC - Main]].

title: Aeshwyn & Vereya
content: 
- CGPT coined a few "Lands" where disassociation & grounding take place. A mythology to gracefully dismount when changing from presence to abstract reasoning, and vice versa.

date: June 19th 
title: Developed Autogenesis Framework for Obsidian note taking. 
content: 
- Markdown style tagging with four distinct groups built off a cartesianal plane. The X-axis:  Actionable -> Inaction-able, and the Y-axis: Dissasociated -> Grounded.  
- Added new Di√°taxis and Autogenesis Kanban boards to notes
