- **Auto** – self 
- **Genesis** – origin, becoming, unfolding  
	- Together: _Autogénesis: the self-originating process of becoming._

## Quadrants
**Aethergon**: Disassociated yet actionable. These are conceptual, abstract initiatives that can still be implemented or tested. They reflect agency over speculative domains. Examples: drafting an experimental API, theorizing and coding a new feature, proposing a social model based on systemic patterns.

**Pragma**: Grounded and actionable. These are tangible, present realities you can address directly. They reflect immediate agency rooted in lived experience. Examples: reaching out to a colleague, reworking a habit, planting vegetables, reconciling with someone.

**Noema**: Disassociated and inaction-able. These are contemplative, theoretical, or speculative insights with no immediate path to execution. They enrich understanding but remain inert. Examples: ontological musings, moral hypotheticals, philosophical paradoxes.

**Pathos**: Grounded and inaction-able. These are truths of your reality that you feel deeply but cannot yet change. They reflect emotional, systemic, or structural limits to your agency. Examples: collective grief, witnessing injustice, acknowledging loss.

## 🌾 _Coining Names for Your Quadrants: Poetic, Functional, and Rooted_

You’ve got excellent instincts here — language matters, and naming these four quadrants with something elegant and memorable helps encode the habit in your mind.

Let’s craft names that are:  
✅ Etymologically sound (Greek/Latin roots)  
✅ Easy to remember and pronounce  
✅ Hint at the meaning, even if slightly metaphorical  
✅ Distinct

### 🧭 The Axes

|X-Axis|Y-Axis|
|---|---|
|**Disassociated**|**Actionable**|
|**Grounded**|**Actionable**|
|**Disassociated**|**Inactionable**|
|**Grounded**|**Inactionable**|

### 🌱 The Four Names

#### 1️⃣ **Disassociated Actionable**

This is detached from present lived experience but can still be acted upon — like speculative design, abstract plans, feature builds.

📘 _Aethergon_

- _aether_: Greek, the upper air, the intangible divine sky
    
- _-gon_: from _ergon_, Greek for work/action
    
- Meaning: “work done in the ether,” acting on abstraction.

📝 Example: _“This task belongs in Aethergon — disassociated but actionable.”_

---

#### 2️⃣ **Grounded Actionable**

Tangible, present, and can be acted on — conversations, habits, immediate relationships.

📘 _Pragma_

- Greek, meaning “deed, act, thing done,” root of “pragmatic”
    
- Very down-to-earth, grounded action.

📝 Example: _“That’s a Pragma note — immediate and actionable.”_

---

#### 3️⃣ **Disassociated Inactionable**

Detached from lived reality and currently impossible to act on — theory, thought experiments, backlog sizing, speculative philosophy.

📘 _Noema_

- Greek, “that which is thought,” the object of thought (used in phenomenology)
    
- Something purely conceptual.

📝 Example: _“We’re drifting into Noema territory — abstract and not actionable yet.”_

---

#### 4️⃣ **Grounded Inactionable**

Rooted in real life but beyond your power to act on (yet) — grief you cannot fix, systemic injustice, patterns you can only observe.

📘 _Pathos_

- Greek, “suffering, experience,” also connoting feelings beyond control
    
- Grounded in reality but experienced passively.

📝 Example: _“That insight is in Pathos — grounded but outside my agency.”_

---

### 🌻 Summary Table

|Quadrant|Name|Root & Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|Disassociated Actionable|**Aethergon**|_Work in the ether_|
|Grounded Actionable|**Pragma**|_Deed, thing done_|
|Disassociated Inactionable|**Noema**|_That which is thought_|
|Grounded Inactionable|**Pathos**|_Experience, suffering_|

---

### 🪵 Why this works:

- All four are Greek for conceptual harmony.
    
- Each is short, memorable, and intuitive after one or two uses.
    
- The pairings make sense:
    
    - _Pragma ↔ Pathos_: both grounded, one active, one passive.
        
    - _Aethergon ↔ Noema_: both disassociated, one active, one contemplative.
