- Dismiss your thought and move on. Don't trust your brain so easily. Find something to distract yourself immediately.
- I'm an INTJ personality type.
- Those who make peaceful resolution impossible, then make violent resolution inevitable. - JFK
- The thing about life and death situations, is that who survives & who "wins" depends entirely upon who calls the shots and where their interests lie. A few things to note: 
	1. Winning is ambiguous when death is the precursor to victory. 
	2. The shot caller is still human, their desires can change on a whim. 
	3. There are no good guys (there are good guys, but they either die a hero, or live long enough to make an ambiguous choice with dire consequences). Just humans with different alliances and heavy emotional ties to those around them. There can be bad guys, but they'll often believe they're doing the right thing.
	4. "Peace is over-rated, it only gets you killed" - Murphy, The 100
- A person who can't obey themselves is destined to be commanded by another. A person who stands for nothing, will fall for anything. 
- I think it's good to have dreams based in reality.
- Being a good conversationalist is as easy as asking a question and then really listening to the answer. "Press A to speak." Question: What's the real life equivalent of pressing A?
- In the face of uncertainty, generate an assumption and then work forward from there.
- Never 'schedule' time with family, family comes first.
- Conflict avoidant people can't be with conflict avoidant people. Resentment will build and build until someone boils over. 
- State your intentions when communicating with your partner and others. This will help to clear the air before they make assumptions.
- Each and every individual has a yard they take care of in their mind, some put up fences, others plant flowers and welcome foot traffic. Either way, respect how people tend to their yard.
- Follow up: "I'm the book you've always opened, but you never read" - TSSF. Some people will take your time, but never pay attention to you. 
- Fear of knowledge and the belief that the past is obsolete. These are the ideals that lead to the fall of the The Library of Alexandria.
- Equip -> Explore -> Exploit -> Equip -> ...
- The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.
- I must not fear. Fear is the mind killer. Fear is the little death that brings obliteration. I will face my fear and permit it to pass over me and through me.
- If a civilization began before ours, it seems possible that even at the speed of currently envisioned interstellar travel, they could have colonized the galaxy. We haven't detected any such civilization, nor have they attempted to contact us...why?
- Kids are a mirror into the past of their parents. A reminder to live for the sake of life, and not survival.
