> ‘This thou must always bear in mind, what is the nature of the whole, and what is thy nature, and how this is related to that, and what kind of a part it is of what kind of a whole; and that there is no one who hinders thee from always doing and saying the things which are according to the nature of which thou art a part.‘“

Marcus Aurelius structures his meditations like Boolean gates: double negatives, mental firewalls, checks against corrupted thinking. The passage instructs constant remembrance:
1. The nature of the whole (cosmos, order).
2. The nature of oneself (rational, social being).
3. The relation between the two (a part within a body).
4. The inalienable freedom: no one can stop the choice to act and speak in accord with nature.

The modern instinct is to translate this as “Live true to yourself. No one can stop you but you.” Yet closer fidelity suggests: <span style="background:#40a9ff">“Live true to your role as part of the whole. Integrity is untouchable, whatever fate takes.”</span>

This is not a call to act, but a call to frame—to debug thought until it runs without contradiction.
