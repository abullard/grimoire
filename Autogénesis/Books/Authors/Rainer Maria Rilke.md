### Letters to a Young Poet, 1903-1908

> [!Quote] Paris, February 17th 1903
>  ”Go inside yourself. Discover the motive that bids you write; examine whether it sends its roots down to the deepest places of your heart, confess to yourself whether you would have to die if writing were denied you. This before all: ask yourself in the quietest hour of your night: must I write?”
>  
> “I would finally just like to advise you to grow through your development quietly and seriously; you can interrupt it in no more violent manner than by looking outwards, and expecting answer from outside to questions which perhaps only your innermost feeling in your most silent hour can answer.”

> [!quote] Viareggio near Pisa (Italy), April 5th 1903
> ”…for fundamentally, and precisely in the deepest and most important things, we are unspeakably alone, and a great deal must happen in order that one man may be able to advise or even help another.“
>  
> “…irony: Do not let yourself be governed by it, especially not in unproductive moments.”

> [!quote] Viareggio near Pisa (Italy), April 23rd 1903
> “…the natural growth of your inner life will lead you slowly in the course of time to other perceptions. Let your judgements have their own quiet undisturbed development, which must, like all progress, come from deep within, and cannot in any way be pressed or hurried.“
> 
> ”…patience is all!”
> 
> “It is not without blemish, it bears the imprint of time and of passion, and little of it will endure and persist. (But most art is like that!)”

> [!quote] Temporarily at Worpswede near Bremen, July 16th 1903
> ”I would like to beg you, dear Sir, as well as I can, to have patience with everything that is unsolved in your heart and to try to cherish the questions themselves, like closed rooms and like books written in a very strange tongue.”
> 
> “It is a matter of living everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, one distant day live right into the answer.”
>   
>   “…be glad of your growing, into which you can take no one else with you, and be good to those that remain behind, and be self-possessed and quiet with them and do not torment them with your doubts and do not frighten them with your confidence or joy, which they could not comprehend.”
>   
>   “…and make allowance for those aging people who fear the solitude in which you trust.”

> [!quote] Rome, December 23rd 1903
> “…only pay attention to what arises within you, and set it above everything that you notice about you. Your inmost happening is worth your whole love, that is what you must somehow work at, and not lose too much time and too much courage in explaining your attitude to people.”
> 
> “I can only advise you to consider whether all professions are not like that, full of demands, full of hostility against the individual, saturated so to say with the hatred of those who have reconciled themselves mutely and morosely to their own insipid duty.”
> 
> “Is it not much rather the case that you have never yet possessed him? [God]”
> 
> “Why do you not think that he who draws near from all eternity is still to come, that he is in the future, the final fruit of a tree whose leaves we are?”
> 
> “…living your life as a painful and beautiful day in the history of a great gestation?”
> 
> “If he is the most perfect, must not the inferior precede him…”

> [!quote] Rome, May 14th 1904
> “This step forward will change the love experience that now is full of error, alter it fundamentally, refashion it into a relationship meant to be between one human being and another, no longer between man and wife.”

> [!quote] Borgeby Gård, Flādie, Sweden, August 12th 1904
> “That is fundamentally the only courage which is demanded of us : to be brave in the face of the strangest, most singular and most inexplicable things that can befall us.”
> 
> “…death, all these things that are so closely related to us, have been so crowded out of life by our daily warding them off, that the senses by which we might apprehend them are stunted.”
> 
> “Why do you want to exclude any disturbance, any pain, any melancholy from your life, since you do not know what these conditions are working upon you?”

> [!quote] Furuborg, Jonsered, Sweden, November 4th 1904
> “Whether my letters could be truly a help, I often doubt. Do not say : ’yes, they are’. Accept them quietly and without many thanks, and let us wait to see what will come.”
> 
> “…life and of death, and the greatness and splendor of both. 
> Yours: 
> Rainer Maria Rilke”
