### Curious, Published April 30th 2014
- Read from 2023-2025
- Main take-away:
	- There are two types of curiousity. Shallow & deep. One drives you to learn the in’s and out’s your interests. The other introduces you to a wide breadth of concepts, but not very deeply.
	- Over time, we build a database of facts in our brains. This database makes it easier and faster to perform information synthesis, retrieval, and storage. Obviously you get better at learning the more you learn. 
	- Answering all your kids questions is the easiest way to keep them curious. Curiosity breeds intelligence.
