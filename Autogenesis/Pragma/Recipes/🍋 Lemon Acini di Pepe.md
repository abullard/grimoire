## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp butter, divided
- ½ shallot, finely diced
- Salt & black pepper, to taste
- Red pepper flakes, to taste
- 1 cup **acini di pepe**

## Method
1) **Sauté the aromatics**  
    Melt half the butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Add shallot, a pinch of salt, and red pepper flakes. Cook until softened, about 3–4 minutes.
2) **Cook the peppers**  
    Thinly slice the red and yellow peppers into strips. In a separate pan, warm a drizzle of olive oil. Sauté peppers with salt and pepper until tender, adding a splash of water to prevent browning. Set aside.
3) **Toast the pasta**  
    Add uncooked acini di pepe to the skillet with the shallots. Stir and toast for 2–3 minutes to bring out a nutty flavor.
4) **Simmer the sauce**  
    Pour in chicken broth, cream, and a pinch more salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer gently for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until pasta is tender and sauce thickens.
5) **Finish & serve**  
    Stir in the remaining butter, sautéed peppers, Parmesan to taste, lemon zest, and juice. Mix well. Taste for seasoning.
6) **Garnish**  
    Plate it up and shower with more Parmesan. Serve warm.

### Notes
- Adjust red pepper flakes to your heat preference.
- If sauce thickens too much, loosen with a splash of broth or water.
- For extra brightness, finish with fresh herbs like parsley or basil.
