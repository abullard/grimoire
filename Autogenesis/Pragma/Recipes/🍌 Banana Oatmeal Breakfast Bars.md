## Method
NaN) **Mix the batter**  
    In a bowl, mash bananas and mix in peanut butter, oats, almonds, chocolate chips, honey, and cinnamon. Stir until well combined.
NaN) **Prep the pan**  
    Lightly spray or grease a muffin tin.
NaN) **Fill the cups**  
    Spoon batter evenly into muffin cups, smoothing the tops.
NaN) **Bake**  
    Bake at 350°F (175°C) for about 30 minutes, until set and lightly golden.
NaN) **Cool & set**  
    Let cool in the pan — they’ll firm up as they rest.

## Notes  
- Enjoy 3 muffins with a cup of coffee for ~500 kcal.  
- Great to make ahead and keep in the fridge for a few days.

---

## Storage & Reheating
- Store muffins in an airtight container at room temp for 1–2 days, or in the fridge for up to 5 days.  
- For longer storage, freeze them individually wrapped for up to a month — thaw overnight in the fridge or microwave for ~30 seconds.  
- Best enjoyed slightly warm.

## Variations & Swaps
- **Nut-free:** Use sunflower seed butter and omit almonds. Add pumpkin seeds or shredded coconut for texture.  
- **Vegan:** Use maple syrup instead of honey, and dairy-free chocolate chips.  
- **Add-ins:** Chia seeds, dried cranberries, or a pinch of nutmeg work beautifully here.
