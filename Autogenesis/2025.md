date: August 4th
title: Copilot Obsidian!?
content: 
- Found out you can hook up an LLM to obsidian, right in the app. It has the entire vault as context to work with. This is a game changer. Curious how much it costs...

date: July 30th
title: Found Map of Content Organization
content: 
- No need to worry about how organized my folder structure is. I can just make a Map of Contents (MoC) for anything. It works as a drill-in from more abstract concepts to more concrete, the farther in you go. Start with [[MoC - Main]].

date: ~July 27th
title: Aeshwyn & Vereya
content: 
- CGPT coined a few "Lands" where disassociation & grounding take place. A mythology to gracefully dismount when changing from presence to abstract reasoning, and vice versa.

date: June 19th 
title: Developed Autogenesis Framework for Obsidian note taking. 
content: 
- Markdown style tagging with four distinct groups built off a cartesianal plane. The X-axis:  Actionable -> Inaction-able, and the Y-axis: Dissasociated -> Grounded.  
- Added new Di√°taxis and Autogenesis Kanban boards to notes
