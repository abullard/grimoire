> Help me understand the difference between liberalism and neo-liberalism. What's the etymology of the names? One is rights of the individual, one is rights of the market. how is liberalism different than liberal or "lib-tard" as people say.

You’ve already sniffed out the tension here: two words from the same root carrying very different connotations in today’s world. Let me untangle this like a careful gardener pruning a gnarly vine.

---

## 🌱 **1. Liberalism: roots & meaning**

**Etymology:**  
From Latin _liber_ (“free”), through Old French _liberal_ (“generous, free”), and into English to mean “freedom” in a political sense. 📘 _Liberalism_ means, at its 17th–18th century core, the philosophy that **individuals have inherent rights to freedom and equality under the law**, particularly _freedom from arbitrary authority_.

**Historical context:**

- Born in the Enlightenment as a reaction against monarchies and feudal hierarchies.
    
- Thinkers: John Locke (property & liberty), Adam Smith (markets & trade, but under moral constraints), John Stuart Mill (individual liberty & harm principle).
    
- Core ideas: individual rights, rule of law, representative government, equality before the law, and freedom of expression/religion.

So, “liberalism” is not about unrestrained markets or being “left-wing” per se — it’s about **protecting individual autonomy from tyranny**, whether by kings, mobs, or states.

## 🌱 **2. Neoliberalism: roots & meaning**

**Etymology:**  
Neo- (Greek: _new_) + liberalism → literally “new liberalism,” but in practice it’s something quite different.

**Historical context:**

- 1930s–1970s: In response to what its proponents saw as excessive state control (e.g., socialism, heavy Keynesian welfare states), a group of economists (Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman) revived certain _classical liberal_ ideas.
    
- However: whereas classical liberalism often balanced market freedom with civic virtue and social stability, **neoliberalism became the ideology of free markets as ends in themselves**.
    
- Core ideas: deregulation, privatization, cutting public spending, weakening labor protections, and treating markets as the ultimate mechanism for allocating goods, services, and even social value.

As you phrased it — well — neoliberalism privileges **the “rights” of markets over the rights of people**, in practice if not always in rhetoric.

## 🌱 **3. Liberal vs. “liberal” (and ‘lib-tard’)**

Here’s where the culture war muddies the waters.

**In U.S. politics:**

- “Liberal” has come to mean broadly left-leaning, socially progressive, pro-government-intervention-in-the-economy.
    
- This is quite ironic, because classical liberalism was skeptical of government power. Modern American liberals evolved by blending classical liberal concern for rights with social democratic concern for welfare and equality.

**Why the slur?**

- On the American right, “liberal” became a pejorative in the Cold War as liberals were associated with being soft on communism, permissive, or anti-traditional.
    
- “Lib-tard” is an offensive and ignorant portmanteau of “liberal” and “retard,” used to insult left-leaning people by implying they are foolish or mentally deficient. It’s less an argument than a crude dismissal. (The fact that some liberals today also embrace neoliberal economic assumptions is rarely noticed by those who throw this insult around.)

## 🔎 **Why does this matter?**

It’s important to see that:

- **Liberalism ≠ contemporary U.S. liberalism ≠ neoliberalism.**
    
- Liberalism at its best defends the individual against arbitrary power.
    
- Neoliberalism often uses liberal rhetoric to justify corporate power and inequality.
    
- The U.S. left and right both distort “liberal” in different ways — the left sometimes seeing it as not radical enough, the right treating it as synonymous with moral decline.

## 🪞 **Critical note:**

Even within liberalism’s noble history there are tensions — between liberty and equality, between property rights and social justice, between individual and collective responsibilities. Neoliberalism often hijacks the liberty side to undermine the equality side. Meanwhile, the word “liberal” has become a punchline because few bother to distinguish philosophy from party politics.

## If you want, I can sketch you:

✅ A timeline of these shifts.  
✅ Or a few pithy counterpoints for when someone dismisses “liberals” without nuance.

Or… let me ask _you_:  
Do you see yourself more concerned with the **freedom from power**, or the **freedom to flourish**, or both? Because that’s at the heart of why these words still matter.
