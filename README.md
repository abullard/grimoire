Note: If you're reading this on Github, there's going to be a lot of features that don't work. 
- Backlinks like `[[Glossary]]` won't work.
- ```[dataview(JS)?|tasks|etc]``` blocks won't work.
- Maybe others? 
## Welcome 🤙
Welcome to my brain. Think I'm calling this *Instruction Set: Human* for now. That was LLM generated, credit where credit is due.

So full disclosure. There will be a ton of errors in here. That's entirely the point. I'm human. Trying to find my way through this bizarre place.

I rely on LLMs to help me *explode context* on topics I'm interested in, questions I have, and content generation–for when I really don't want to spice up a recipe into a README by myself. I recognize that it's a computer, I recognize that it hallucinates. I just try to ask better questions, and tell myself that I lie to me too. 

See, we catalog data in our brains constantly. We categorize and file away memories, feelings, & facts–however wrong. But when we contend with that information, when we actually apply that information, if it's wrong, it'll surface.

*Tempering* is the act of refining steel in fire. Here, we're refining answers to questions. Applying the knowledge, and determining their accuracy. 

So, that's what I do here. I temper my thoughts by kindly asking an LLM to "rapidly tokenize *n (beam width)* sentences and compile as much information as it can process in one request". I then, analyze and *sometimes* act on the advice/information when it makes sense. 

First and foremost, get your hands on a copy of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and open this vault up there for the best experience. At this moment I'm running `v1.8.10`. <- who knows if I'll update *this* again, but I'll for sure update the app 😂

A *Map of Content (MoC)* is a table of contents–full of links to other pages in this repo. This lets me store files in any folder structure without having to worry about files being in the "wrong" place. I can add a link to the MoC, and boom. All my cooking recipes are on one page. 

For any definitions of things you don't know, but sound like they're ripped out of Neuromancer by William Gibson, check the [[Glossary]]\*. Lots of terms are marked with 📘.

Here's your key 🗝️ to the front door, [[MoC - Main]]. The Homepage plugin will keep it open if you're using Obsidian. This'll help keep you oriented in the maze.

Warmest Regards,

Austin Bullard 🍻
