*A fast, fragrant dish full of summer vibes. Serves 2.*

---

## Ingredients  
- 4 tbsp olive oil  
- 1½ cups orzo pasta  
- 2 garlic cloves  
- Handful fresh basil, torn (to taste)  
- 1 cup grape tomatoes, halved (de-seeded if you feel fancy)  
- ¼ tsp crushed red pepper flakes  
- ¼ cup reserved pasta water  
- ¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for serving  
- Salt & black pepper, to taste

## Method
1) **Prep the toppings**  
    Halve the tomatoes and de-seed if you like. Tear basil into small pieces. Grate Parmesan. Set aside.
2) **Build the base**  
    Mince or mash the garlic directly into a large skillet. Add olive oil and red pepper flakes. Set skillet aside for now.
3) **Cook the orzo**  
    Boil orzo just to _al dente_ (check the lowest recommended time). With about 3 minutes left on the timer, turn the skillet to medium heat so the garlic begins to sizzle just as the pasta finishes.
4) **Combine**  
    Strain orzo straight into the skillet (reserve ¼ cup of the starchy cooking water and add it to the skillet too).
5) **Finish the dish**  
    Stir in tomatoes, basil, Parmesan, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat slightly and cook until cheese melts and everything is glossy.
6) **Serve & garnish**  
    Divide into bowls and top with more Parmesan.
7) **Enjoy.**
