You agree to defend and hold harmless H&R Block, H&R Block Affiliates and their respective current and former successors, assigns, officers, directors, representatives, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, suits, settlements, losses, liabilities, penalties, damages (including incidental and consequential damages), costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) resulting from or arising out of your breach of this Agreement.

12)	ARBITRATION IF A DISPUTE ARISES (“Arbitration Agreement”).

12.1.	Scope of Arbitration Agreement. You and the H&R Block Parties agree that all disputes and claims between you and the H&R Block Parties shall be resolved through binding individual arbitration unless you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement using the process explained below. However, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, either you or the H&R Block Parties may elect that an individual claim be decided in small claims court, as long as it is brought and maintained as an individualized claim and is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the arbitrability of disputes and the validity, enforceability, and scope of this Arbitration Agreement, including the interpretation of and compliance with paragraphs 12.2, 12.4, and 12.6 below, shall be decided by a court and not an arbitrator. If you are preparing or filing a joint tax return, the term “you” in this Arbitration Agreement refers to both taxpayers. The term “you” in this Arbitration Agreement also refers to any dependents you claim on your tax return. The terms “H&R Block Parties” or “we” or “us” in this Arbitration Agreement include HRB Digital LLC, HRB Tax Group, Inc., and Emerald Financial Services, LLC, along with their predecessors, successors, and assigns, and each of the past, present, and future direct or indirect parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, employees, and franchisees of any of them.

Arbitration Agreement Opt Out: You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days after you accept this Agreement by filling out the form at www.hrblock.com/goto/optout, or by sending a signed letter to Arbitration Agreement Opt Out, P.O. Box 32818, Kansas City, MO 64171. The letter should include your printed name, address, the last four digits of your Social Security Number, and the words “Arbitration Agreement Opt Out.” If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, any prior arbitration agreement shall remain in force and effect.  

12.2.	Commencing arbitration. You or we may commence an arbitration proceeding only if you and we do not reach an agreement to resolve the dispute or claim during the Informal Resolution Period (defined below). 

12.2.1.	Pre-arbitration notice of dispute. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first mail a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) to the other party. The Notice to the H&R Block Parties should be addressed to: H&R Block-Legal Department, Attention: Notice of Dispute, One H&R Block Way, Kansas City, MO 64105. The Notice to you will be sent to the last known address on file with the H&R Block Parties. The Notice must be on an individual basis and include all of the following: (1) the claimant’s name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and last four digits of Social Security Number; (2) the nature or basis of the dispute or claim; (3) the specific relief sought; and (4) the claimant’s signature.

12.2.2.	Informal Settlement Conference. After the Notice containing all of the information required above is received, within 60 days either party may request an individualized discussion (by telephone or videoconference) regarding informal resolution of the dispute (“Informal Settlement Conference”). If timely requested, the parties will work together in good faith to select a mutually agreeable time for the Informal Settlement Conference. You and our business representative must both personally participate in a good-faith effort to settle the dispute without the need to proceed with arbitration. The requirement of personal participation in an Informal Settlement Conference may be waived only if both you and we agree in writing. Any counsel representing you or us may also participate; however, if you have retained counsel, a signed statement is required by law to authorize the H&R Block Parties to disclose your confidential tax and account records to your counsel. Any applicable statute of limitations will be tolled for the claims and relief set forth in the Notice during the period between the date that either you or we send the other a fully complete Notice, until the later of (1) 60 days after receipt of the Notice; or (2) if a Settlement Conference is timely requested, 30 days after completion of the Settlement Conference (the “Informal Resolution Period”). The parties agree that the existence or substance of any settlement discussions are confidential and shall not be disclosed, except as provided by applicable law.

12.2.3.	Enforcement of pre-arbitration requirements. The Notice and Informal Settlement Conference requirements are essential so that you and we have a meaningful chance to resolve disputes informally before proceeding to arbitration. A court will have authority to enforce this paragraph 12.2, including the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration or the assessment of or demand for payment of fees in connection with an arbitration, if the party who intends to seek arbitration does not first provide a fully complete Notice and participate in a timely requested Informal Settlement Conference. In addition, unless prohibited by applicable law, the arbitration administrator shall not accept, assess or demand fees for, or administer an arbitration commenced during the Informal Resolution Period.

12.3.	How arbitration works. Arbitration shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules and, if applicable, the AAA Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules are available on AAA’s website www.adr.org. If AAA is unavailable or unwilling to administer the arbitration consistent with this Arbitration Agreement, the parties shall agree to, or the court shall select, another arbitration provider. Unless the parties agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing shall take place in the county of your residence. If you accept this Agreement outside the United States, the arbitration hearing shall take place in the county in which you last resided in the United States. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney specifically licensed to practice law in the state of your residence and selected by the parties from the arbitration provider’s national roster of arbitrators. The arbitrator will be selected using the following procedure: (1) the arbitration provider will send the parties a list of five candidates meeting this criteria; (2) if the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator from the list, each party shall return its list to the arbitration provider within 10 days, striking up to two candidates, and ranking the remaining candidates in order of preference; (3) the arbitration provider shall appoint as arbitrator the candidate with the highest aggregate ranking; and (4) if for any reason the appointment cannot be made according to this procedure, the arbitration provider will provide the parties a new list of five candidates meeting the above criteria until an appointment can be made. 

12.4.	Waiver of right to bring class action and representative claims. All arbitrations shall proceed on an individual basis. The arbitrator is empowered to resolve the dispute with the same remedies available in court, including compensatory, statutory, and punitive damages; attorneys’ fees; and declaratory, injunctive, and equitable relief. However, the arbitrator’s rulings or any relief granted must be individualized to you and shall not apply to or affect any other client. The arbitrator is also empowered to resolve the dispute with the same defenses available in court, including but not limited to statutes of limitation. You and the H&R Block Parties also agree that each may bring claims against the other in arbitration only in your or their respective individual capacities and in so doing you and the H&R Block Parties hereby waive the right to a trial by jury, to assert or participate in a class action lawsuit or class action arbitration, to assert or participate in a private attorney general lawsuit or private attorney general arbitration, and to assert or participate in any joint or consolidated lawsuit or joint or consolidated arbitration of any kind. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim or any particular request for a remedy for a claim (such as a request for public injunctive relief), then the parties agree that the particular claim or the particular request for a remedy (and only that particular claim or particular request for a remedy) must remain in court and be severed from any arbitration. No arbitration shall proceed in any manner as a class action arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims, unless all parties consent in writing.

12.5.	Arbitration costs. Payment of all filing, administrative, case-management, arbitrator, and hearing fees will be governed by AAA Rules, but if you inform us that you cannot afford to pay your share of the fees, we will consider advancing those fees to the AAA on your behalf and will do so if required by applicable law. In addition, we will reimburse you for your share of the fees at the conclusion of the arbitration (regardless of who wins) so long as (i) you complied with the requirements in paragraphs 12.2 and 12.4 above and paragraph 12.6 below, and (ii) neither the substance of your claim nor the relief you sought was determined to be frivolous or brought for an improper purpose as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b); otherwise, the payment of fees will be governed by AAA Rules and you agree to reimburse the H&R Block Parties for all fees advanced on your behalf.

12.6.	Arbitration of similar claims. If 25 or more claimants submit Notices or seek to file arbitrations raising similar claims and are represented by the same or coordinated counsel (regardless of whether the cases are submitted simultaneously), the AAA’s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules, as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, shall apply, and all of the cases must be resolved in arbitration in stages using staged bellwether proceedings if they are not resolved during the Informal Resolution Period. You agree to this process even though it may delay the arbitration of your claim. You and the H&R Block Parties each agree to notify the AAA if the conditions for applying the provisions in this paragraph 12.6 have been satisfied. In the first stage, each side shall select 15 cases (30 cases total) to be filed in arbitration and resolved individually by different arbitrators, with each case assigned to an arbitrator from the claimant’s home state. In the meantime, no other cases may be filed in arbitration, and the AAA shall not accept, assess or demand fees for, or administer arbitrations that are commenced in violation of this section. The arbitrators are encouraged to resolve the cases within 120 days of appointment or as swiftly as possible, consistent with principles of fundamental fairness. If the remaining cases are unable to be resolved after the conclusion of the first stage bellwether proceeding, the process will be repeated until all claims are resolved through settlement or arbitration, with two alterations. First, each side shall select up to another 50 cases (100 cases total). Second, arbitrators who were previously assigned cases may be appointed to new cases to the extent required if the AAA does not have a sufficient number of arbitrators available. If any claims remain after the second stage, the second stage process will be repeated until all claims are resolved through settlement or arbitration, except that a total of 200 cases may be filed each round (unless a higher number of cases is mutually agreed upon in writing) and the appointment of the arbitrators shall be governed by the AAA rules rather than paragraph 12.3 above. If this paragraph 12.6 applies to a Notice, the statute of limitations applicable to the claims and relief set forth in that Notice shall be tolled from the beginning date of the Informal Resolution Period until that Notice is selected for a bellwether proceeding, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved. A court will have authority to enforce this paragraph 12.6, including to enjoin the filing, assessing or demanding fees for, administration of, or prosecution of arbitrations. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, if this paragraph 12.6 applies to a Notice, you and the H&R Block Parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts in Kansas City, Missouri, to enforce the requirements of this Arbitration Agreement, including the interpretation of and compliance with paragraphs 12.2 and 12.6. Further, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, if this paragraph 12.6 applies to a Notice, you and the H&R Block Parties agree that any of the claimants or the H&R Block Parties may bring a single court proceeding to enforce the requirements of this Arbitration Agreement as to all of the cases that qualify as similar claims under this paragraph 12.6.

12.7.	Other terms. This Arbitration Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted, construed, and enforced in accordance with, the Federal Arbitration Act and other applicable federal law. Except as set forth above in paragraph 12.4, if any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of the Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we will not make any material change to this Arbitration Agreement without providing you with an opportunity to reject that change by following the directions in the notice of changes. Rejection of any future change will not impact this or any other arbitration agreement between you and the H&R Block Parties. No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to any issues or claims in any dispute, arbitration, or court proceeding where any party was not a named party in the arbitration, unless and except as required by applicable law.
