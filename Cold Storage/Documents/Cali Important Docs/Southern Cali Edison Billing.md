## Tiers
**Zone 10 in Riverside County** 
### Winter (October - May)
- Daily Allocation 12.1 kWh
- Monthly Allocation 363 kWh
### Summer (June - September)
- Daily Allocation 19.3 kWh
- Monthly Allocation 584 kWh

## Take-a-ways
- Summer monthly allocation seems to fit our usage. Leave bill as is.
- Re-evaluate for Winter as monthly allocation drops by ~200 kWh, which doesn't work for our usage. These bills will be **$\$\$**
	- Potentially Time Of Day plans will be better during winter? Need to do a cost benefit analysis
