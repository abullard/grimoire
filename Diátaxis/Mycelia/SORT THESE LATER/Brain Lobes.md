## üß† **Functional Lobes (Modules) of the Brain Data Structure:**

- **Prefrontal Cortex (Reasoning/Decision-Making):**
    - Manages goal-oriented searches and resolves conflicts between contradictory nodes.
    - Acts as a "controller" for complex queries, delegating to other lobes.
- **Hippocampus (Memory/Knowledge Index):**
    - Stores long-term knowledge graphs and historical context.
    - Supports fast recall through indexed pathways.
- **Amygdala (Emotional Weighting):**
    - Assigns emotional tags to nodes based on interaction patterns (e.g., highly upvoted nodes carry ‚Äúimportance‚Äù).
    - Affects ranking during traversals.
- **Temporal Lobe (Language & Semantics):**
    - Handles natural language processing, symbol-to-node conversion, and semantic searches.
    - Bridges abstract queries to concrete knowledge.
- **Occipital/Parietal Lobe (Spatial & Pattern Processing):**
    - Optimizes graph traversal strategies (e.g., shortest path algorithms, clustering).
    - Supports pattern recognition across related nodes.

## üîÑ **Inter-Lobe Communication:**

- Use **message-passing protocols** (like in microservice architecture) between lobes.
- Implement **"neural pathways" (graph edges with weighted traversal costs)** based on query type.
- Enable cross-lobe caching for frequent pathways.
- Each lobe contains it's own set of hardware resources, allowing the Lobes to operate in parallel. 
	- Distributed computation reduces overall graph size of individual lobes, speeding up search algorithms
	- *How do we approach cross-lobe neuron consistency?*

## üß© **Why This Matters:**

- **Scalability:** Specialized modules can scale independently.
- **Efficiency:** Shorter query paths with directed, context-aware indexing.
- **Interpretability:** Easier to debug _why_ a particular answer emerged.
