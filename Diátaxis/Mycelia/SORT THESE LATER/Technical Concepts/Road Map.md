## So, what’s next?
If you're open to a little nudge-in-the-ribs product design questioning:

1) **LLM Integration** – What’s your intended interaction model?
    - Is the prompt area just a chat?
    - Or do you plan on generating or modifying graph nodes from it?
    - Should the LLM "see" the current selected node, or the whole visible graph?
2) **Graph Semantics** – Are your nodes just text, or do they encode more?
    - Will you start mapping out node _types_ soon (idea, question, fact, resource, etc)?
    - Planning on embedding or summarizing links or documents?
3) **Neo4j Plans** – Real-time persistence and query for relationships?
    - You could do some slick stuff with Cypher queries feeding back into node creation.
    - Might be worth deciding early if you’ll treat React Flow as truth, or sync to Neo4j as the primary store.
4) **Scaling the UX** – When you’re 100+ nodes deep, what’s the user's compass?
    - Filtering, search, or semantic zoom might come up sooner than you think.
5) **Personality of the LLM** – Is it Socratic, teacherly, sassy? Do you want it to question, support, or guide your thoughts?
