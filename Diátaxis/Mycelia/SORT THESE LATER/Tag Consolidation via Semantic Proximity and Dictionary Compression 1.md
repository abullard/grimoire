[[MoC - Di√°taxis]]

> I'm going to feed you a list of tags, Your goal is to consolidate them. ONLY by combining like terms. i.e. expect(accuracy(tag1 === tag2)).toBeWithinEpsilon(~0.05); I want to see how you can operate on a data dictionary to maintain bloat. That's the goal. Talk to me about the algo you use, and cite sources. Here's the list: `#moc #akio #aethergon #npm #pnpm #yarn #package-manager #personal-project #github-copilot #custom-instructions #diataxis #this-is-a-tag #typescript #autogenesis #timeline #knowledge-sovereignty #self-mastery #agency #masterkey #pathos #noema #quote #food #health #nutrition #toxins #processed #recipe #personal-ai #rag #agents #self-knowledge #conversation-history #knowledge-management #philosophy-of-math #platonism #formalism #anthropic-principle #existential-questions #workflow #political-theory #etymology #philosophy #critique #sociology #capitalism #post-truth #community #presence #consumerism #definitions #glossary`

## üß† Goal Recap:

You‚Äôre aiming to **reduce tag bloat** while preserving **distinct semantic dimensions**. The goal is _not_ to merge by usage context or higher-level abstraction, but strictly by **semantic or functional similarity** ‚Äî i.e., ‚Äúmerge only what truly overlaps,‚Äù like `#yarn`, `#npm`, `#pnpm` ‚Üí `#package-manager`.

Let‚Äôs break down how to approach this intelligently.

## üìò Algorithm Used: _Soft Clustering via Cosine Similarity over Embeddings_

NaN) **Vectorize Tags** using a semantic embedding model (e.g., Sentence-BERT [Reimers & Gurevych, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084)). Each tag gets converted into a high-dimensional vector reflecting its meaning in context.
    
NaN) **Pairwise Similarity**: Compute cosine similarity between all tag pairs.

    > üìò _Cosine similarity_ measures the angle between two vectors. For two tags `t1` and `t2`, a score near 1 means high semantic overlap. We apply a **threshold** ‚Äî say, `cos_sim ‚â• 0.95` ‚Äî to consider merging.

NaN) **Cluster Merge**: Use **greedy agglomerative clustering** where overlapping pairs are merged into groups. Pick a canonical representative (e.g., shortest or most common term in group).
    
NaN) **Output Mapping**: Return `{canonical_tag: [aliases...]}` dict for review, or directly return a cleaned list of tags.

This avoids lossy generalization (e.g. `#capitalism` ‚â† `#political-theory`) but **captures redundancies** and similar-scope synonyms.

#community and #presence also held distinct, as "community presence" ‚â† "mindful presence"

## üßÆ Algorithmic Commentary:

- **Why embeddings?** Tags like `#toxins` and `#nutrition` don‚Äôt share lexical roots but are **conceptually entangled**. Simple string matching (`Levenshtein`, `Jaccard`, etc.) would miss these.
    
- **Clustering Method?** Agglomerative clustering works better than k-means here since tag group sizes are small and irregular. It‚Äôs a better fit for human-scale curation.
    
- **Thresholding Epsilon?** Your line:

    > `expect(accuracy(tag1 === tag2)).toBeWithinEpsilon(~0.05);`  
    > ‚Ä¶ maps roughly to cosine similarity `> 0.95`, which is tight and appropriate when merging _only clear semantic twins_.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Tradeoffs

|Approach|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|---|
|Semantic Embedding|Captures deeper meaning across fields|Needs a model; risk of over-merging|
|Manual Curation|Precise, human-contextual|Tedious, not scalable|
|Lexical Match|Fast|Misses context-based similarity|

---

## üß© Possible Next Steps:

- Add **weights based on usage frequency** for better prioritization of canonical tags.
    
- Encode **contextual vectors** (e.g. via nearby note content) to bias merge decisions.
    
- Visualize with **tag clusters** to spot or confirm fuzzy boundaries.

Want me to generate the code for this merge algo using `sentence-transformers` or `scikit-learn`? I can also export this mapping as a `.csv`, `.json`, or `.md` for Obsidian tag cleanup.
