## Backlog

- [ ] Install Ollama Model locally, roughly equivalent to GPT-4o or Claude Sonnet 3.5
- [ ] BFS of files by tag, probably use Sentence-BERT to semantic match by cosine similarity? Gotta look this ish up
- [ ] Hook up local ollama LLM to Obsidian copilot? May need LM studio for CORS enabling. idk
- [ ] Maybe change tags to Frontmatter? Less pretty, more functionality?
