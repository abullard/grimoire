[[MoC - Akio|Parent]]

For a small but useful CLI module like **Akio**, the goal is to signal **trust, stability, and low friction**. You don‚Äôt need heavyweight tooling‚Äîbut the right surface polish and automation can help people adopt it faster. Here's a lean but professional setup you can aim for across **GitHub** and **npm**:

---

## üîß Tooling + Trust Checklist

### ‚úÖ **1. Clean README + Badges**

- At minimum, include these badges at the top of your `README.md`:

    ```md
    ![Build](https://github.com/yourname/akio/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)
    ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/akio)
    ![License](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/akio)
    ```

- Optionally:
    
    - `bundlephobia` badge: shows size
        
    - `downloads/week`: shows traction

---

### ‚úÖ **2. GitHub Actions for CI**

Much easier than Travis these days, and it‚Äôs native to GitHub.

**`.github/workflows/test.yml`**:

```yaml
name: Test

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
```

> Bonus: add `build` step too if you‚Äôre compiling (e.g., with `esbuild` or `tsup`).

---

### ‚úÖ **3. Unit Tests with Coverage**

Use something minimal like [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) or [uvu](https://github.com/lukeed/uvu) for CLI tools.

```bash
npm i -D vitest
```

Then `npm test` runs:

```bash
vitest run
```

Keep tests dead simple: you‚Äôre just validating output, options, and maybe a dry-run.

---

### ‚úÖ **4. Lint & Format**

Helps show this is cared for and stable.

```bash
npm i -D eslint prettier
```

Add a script:

```json
"scripts": {
  "lint": "eslint .",
  "format": "prettier --check ."
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ **5. GitHub Topics + Description**

On the repo itself:

- Add a short tagline:

    > _‚ÄúInteractive CLI for listing and running package scripts with descriptions.‚Äù_

- Add tags: `cli`, `scripts`, `npm`, `terminal`, `developer-tools`

---

### ‚úÖ **6. Versioning + Releases**

Use [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) or just stick with `npm version patch && npm publish` and tag your GitHub releases. Simple changelogs go a long way.

---

### ‚úÖ **7. TypeScript or JS w/ Types**

You don‚Äôt need to use TypeScript, but publishing a `d.ts` or JSDoc-based types (or even exporting CLI usage from a separate module) helps downstream devs.

If using `esbuild` or `tsup`, you can emit `types.d.ts` easily.

---

### ‚úÖ **8. Good `package.json` Hygiene**

Make sure you include:

- `bin` field:

    ```json
    "bin": {
      "akio": "./bin/index.js"
    }
    ```

- `files`: whitelist your publishable files
    
- `keywords`: helps discoverability
    
- `engines`: restrict Node version if needed

---

### ‚úÖ **9. Trust Signals on npmjs.com**

When people land on npm:

- Nice logo (optional)
    
- Clean README (you already have)
    
- Clear command example
    
- Links to GitHub and issues
    
- Few dependencies (or stable ones)

---

## üç± Bonus (optional)

- `commitlint` and `husky` to enforce commit messages
    
- `prepublishOnly` script that checks build + tests before releasing
    
- `types` if used as a module in code (not just CLI)

---

If you want, I can scaffold this whole setup for you (`package.json`, `test.yml`, `vitest`, etc.) in a quick boilerplate. Just say the word.
