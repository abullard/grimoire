> Talk to me about how the embedding of tags starts to mirror a Map of Content in obsidian? Can I make a map of content of tags as well? I could see how #political-theory could surface itself as a top level MOC, and then capitalism can have it's own MOC, as consumerism can too. Layer these and you end up with a table of contents of tags which are just concepts? so anything you want to know about me, you just drill down into the tags to find it?

## 🧭 TL;DR

Yes — embeddings let your **tags behave like spatial concepts**, and you absolutely _can_ build a Map of Content (MoC) of tags. This becomes a **semantic table of contents** of your thoughtspace. You’re turning **atomic metadata** into **a concept map**, where drilling into `#capitalism` reveals its **sub-MoC**, like `#consumerism`, `#post-truth`, or `#sociology`.

You're not just building a knowledge vault. You're terraforming it into a **living semantic terrain.**

## 🔍 Tags as Coordinates in Thoughtspace

Each tag, when embedded into vector space (via something like [Sentence-BERT](https://www.sbert.net/)), isn’t just a label anymore — it becomes a **position in a conceptual topology**. Tags like:

- `#capitalism`, `#consumerism`, `#political-theory`, `#post-truth`

…will naturally **cluster** near each other. This cluster _is_ your emergent **MoC** on political philosophy.

> 📘 _Embedding_: A process of converting text (tags, phrases) into high-dimensional vectors that encode semantic meaning.

Now imagine:

- `#sociology` sits at the **border** between `#political-theory` and `#community`.
    
- `#etymology` hovers near `#definitions`, but drifts toward `#philosophy`.

This becomes a **semantic terrain** — and your tags become **nodes in a self-assembling ontology**.

## 🧱 How This Mirrors an Obsidian MoC

A traditional [Map of Content](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview-map-of-content/) in Obsidian is:

- A note containing structured links
    
- Often hierarchical (`#philosophy` → `#ethics`, `#logic`, etc.)
    
- Sometimes manually curated

But **embedding-powered tag clusters** offer a **dynamic MoC** based on proximity:

|Traditional MoC|Embedding-Based Tag MoC|
|---|---|
|Manually structured|Emerges from similarity|
|Requires upkeep|Self-updating w/ tags|
|Hierarchy by design|Topology by meaning|
|Visualized as trees|Visualized as graphs or vector maps|

Instead of:

> “Here’s a note with links to things I care about,”

…you now say:

> “Here’s a region of my thoughts that gravity pulls together. Enter anywhere. It’s all contextually linked.”

## 🗺️ So Can You Build a Table of Contents of Tags?

Absolutely. Here’s how:

### 🔸 Step 1: Group Tags by Embedding Proximity

Cluster semantically related tags (using cosine similarity thresholding, as above).

### 🔸 Step 2: Choose Canonical “Parent” Tags

Designate central terms (like `#political-theory`) as anchors or _category nodes_.

### 🔸 Step 3: Visualize or Nest

- Build a `tags-moc.md` note in Obsidian
    
- Link:

    ```md
    ## 🧠 Political Theory
    - [[#capitalism]]
    - [[#consumerism]]
    - [[#post-truth]]
    - [[#sociology]]
    
    ## 💊 Health & Nutrition
    - [[#toxins]]
    - [[#nutrition]]
    - [[#food]]
    - [[#processed]]
    ```

### 🔸 Step 4: Auto-generate from a Script

Run a script monthly to:

- Vectorize tags
    
- Cluster them
    
- Output a fresh MoC markdown note with hierarchy

## 💡 Bonus: Tags as Personal Ontology

You're not just organizing thoughts. You’re building a **personal ontology** — a set of concepts that structure how you perceive the world.

> Drill into `#agency`, and you get `#self-mastery`, `#masterkey`, `#pathos`, `#noema` — which may say more about you than your résumé.

This becomes a **universal indexing system**. Anyone exploring your vault could say:

> “I want to know what Okizame thinks about philosophy → political theory → capitalism → consumerism.”

They never need to know your note structure — the **tags tell the story**.

## 🧬 If You Want To Take It Further:

- Use [Obsidian Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) or [Juggl](https://github.com/HEmile/juggl) to visualize tag relationships
    
- Create `.json` tag maps with weights (`importance`, `centrality`) and feed them into GraphView tools
    
- Embed small GPTs into your vault to _generate MoC sections_ for new tags

Would you like a working prototype to auto-generate a tag-based MoC from your vault? Markdown or graphviz-based?
