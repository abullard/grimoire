## ðŸŽ¯ What is Kanban?
**Kanban** is a visual system for managing tasks as they move through stages of progress. It comes from lean manufacturing (Toyota) but is used everywhere now â€” software, art, life planning.

At its heart:

> Kanban makes your work visible and limits how much you juggle at once.

## ðŸ§± Basic Structure

A **Kanban board** has **columns** that represent workflow stages.  
Typical columns are:

- **To Do** â†’ tasks you plan to do
- **In Progress** â†’ tasks you're actively working on
- **Done** â†’ tasks you've completed

---

## ðŸ§¾ Example Board: Writing a Zine

Imagine you're putting together a small personal zine:

### ðŸ“‹ To Do

- Brainstorm article topics
- Gather reference images
- Write interview questions

### ðŸ”¨ In Progress

- Draft: "The Liminal City" essay
- Design cover mockup

### âœ… Done

- Chose theme: "Echoes & Light"
- Set publishing deadline

## ðŸ§  What Makes Kanban Powerful?

- **Visual Progress**: You see where everything stands at a glance
- **Limit Work In Progress**: If youâ€™ve got 6 tasks in "In Progress", it's a red flag
- **Flexible**: You can adapt columns to anything â€” not just To Do/In Progress/Done

Example:  
For a creative pipeline, your columns might be:

> `Ideas` â†’ `Sketching` â†’ `Drafting` â†’ `Editing` â†’ `Published`

## ðŸ§° In Obsidian

The **Kanban plugin** lets you turn a markdown note into a board like that, where each list is a column, and tasks are simple checklist items.

You move tasks by dragging, and they're still just markdown under the hood.
