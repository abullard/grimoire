## Today’s Work / Decisions
- A bunch of minor stories to modify behavior slightly. 

## Insights / Lessons
- I still haven’t learned this somehow, always, *always*, check the ticket you’re about to work on. Is the ticket actually defined? Is there acceptance criteria? It’s always better to rope someone in to check early, than to start work and have to backtrack.
- Really small stories that are a couple lines that need to be changed are very hard to follow the Obsidian documentation process. I need a better system. I also need to document that system in this Grimoire, instead of just my work Grimoire.
