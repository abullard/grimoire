## Today’s Work / Decisions
- Technical decision facilitation all morning. Zoned out all afternoon. Oops.

## Insights / Lessons
- It’s been a long time since I’ve facilitated cross-functional conversation around technical decision resolution. At Deere, I just don’t have a ton of context to operate in the space. When I was at BCT, it was expected. I had just come out of college and was prepared for it. I’ve had to re-enter the headspace, and gain enough domain knowledge to be an effective operator. Re-learning is stressful. But I’m getting skin in the game. I’ve gotta keep making an impact. A name for myself in the local stage, instead of the global stage.
