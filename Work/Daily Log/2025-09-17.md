## Today’s Work / Decisions
- Just because someone submits a defect report, doesn’t mean the defect is really a defect. It may just be unclear behavior.
	- Is there a way we can make the behavior more clear from the git-go?

## Insights / Lessons
- N/A

## Carry Forward
- Today we completed the first User Story Retro. It’s a verbal conversation, with AI transcription turned on, to discuss the problem, solution, pain points, and upstream considerations for future work. The goal is to have a rolling log of what’s working and what’s not after each story. We’d eventually like to tie all of these into RAG (Coupled with a work log + Pull Request Summary).
