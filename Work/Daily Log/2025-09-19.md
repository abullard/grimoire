## Today’s Work / Decisions
- Lots of cross-functional communication. We (easily because they offered :D) got an external team member to commit to changing their system for our needs. This helped keep us unblocked, and made our solution easier to deliver. 

## Insights / Lessons
- Alignment of other teams to continue pushing a schedule that’s already 4 months ahead has the potential to be difficult, but we should keep at it.
