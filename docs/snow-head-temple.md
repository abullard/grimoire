# Snowhead Temple — Technical Reference (The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask)

## Overview

Snowhead Temple is the second major dungeon in _The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask_, located in the Snowhead region. The temple is designed around ice-themed traversal, Goron mechanics, and vertical navigation through a central pillar structure.

---

## Regional Context

- **Location:** Snowhead Mountain, accessible after pacifying the Snowhead "giant" (actually a shivering Goron Elder’s Son illusion produced by the Blizzard).
- **Pre‑Dungeon Requirements:**
  - Obtain the **Goron Mask**.
  - Acquire **Lens of Truth** to reveal the real path and invisible platforms.
  - Possess arrows (and optionally Fire Arrows if sequence‑breaking).

---

## Core Mechanics

### Goron Abilities Utilized

- **Goron Roll:** Used to cross gaps and ascend ramps.
- **Goron Pound (Ground Pound):** Used to smash ice formations.
- **Heavy Weight:** Activates heavy switches and prevents being blown by fans.

### Ice & Fire Interactions

- **Ice Platforms/Blocks:** Many surfaces require melting via Fire Arrows or manipulation through puzzle mechanics.
- **Frozen Enemies:** Can be thawed or bypassed; some drop key items.

### Central Pillar Structure

- A massive internal pillar spans the vertical center of the dungeon.
- Removing sections of the pillar opens vertical pathways between floors.
- Many traversal routes depend on whether certain floors of the pillar have been destroyed.

---

## Floor Layout Summary

Snowhead Temple contains multiple floors (B1 through F3). Many puzzles and routes rely on vertical alignment.

### **F3 (Top Floor)**

- Contains the **Boss Door**.
- Requires raising/lowering platforms via switches on lower floors.

### **F2**

- Key ice block puzzles.
- Rotating platforms controlled by central‑pillar destruction state.

### **F1**

- Major hub access.
- Goron ramps and dangerous icy ledges.

### **B1**

- Contains switches controlling the dungeon’s elevators/platforms.
- Often visited after altering upper floors via pillar destruction.

---

## Key Items Found Within the Temple

### **Dungeon Map**

- Provides full floor visibility.

### **Compass**

- Shows chest and boss/key locations.

### **Fire Arrows (Main Dungeon Item)**

- Unlock progression by melting:
  - Ice barriers.
  - Frozen switches.
  - Frozen enemies.

- Enable multipath navigation and shortcuts.

### **Boss Key**

- Located behind a puzzle requiring melting ice and precision platforming.

---

## Mini-Boss Encounters

### **Wizrobe (Fire Variant)**

- Appears twice (initial + rematch).
- Behaviors:
  - Teleports between platforms.
  - Summons clones.
  - Attacks via fire beams.

- Weak to arrows; Fire Arrows kill faster.

---

## Puzzles & Switch Mechanisms

### Central Pillar Destruction Puzzle

- Strategically remove mid‑pillar layers using Goron Pound.
- Changes platform rotation and path availability.

### Ice Melt Sequences

- Melt ice in correct order to reveal:
  - Switches.
  - Locked doors.
  - Mechanical pivots.

### Fan-Based Traversal

- Certain rooms contain massive fans.
- Goron weight prevents wind effects, enabling safe crossing.

### Rolling Path Challenges

- Long ice-covered ramps requiring Goron Roll precision.
- Sometimes combined with moving platforms.

---

## Enemies

- **Wizrobe** (mini-boss)
- **Dinolfos** / Lizalfos variants
- **Freezepe** (rolling ice hazards)
- **Chuchus** (green/red)
- **Eye Switch mechanisms** activated via arrows

---

## Boss Fight: Goht (Mechanical Masked Beast)

### **Arena Structure**

- Massive circular arena.
- Lined with obstacles (spikes, falling icicles).

### **Primary Strategy**

- Use **Goron Roll** to chase Goht.
- Maintain speed by rolling over magic jars.
- Hit Goht repeatedly until it falls.
- Avoid electricity attacks, boulders, and summons.

### **Alternate Tactics**

- Hero’s Bow shots to slow Goht.
- Fire Arrow hits when Goht is stunned.

### **Rewards**

- **Goht’s Remains** (Dungeon Boss Remains).
- Restores Spring to Snowhead region.

---

## Sequence Notes for Gameplay Logic

- Player typically enters after completing:
  - Mountain Village restoration steps.
  - Goron Elder rescue.

- Completing temple:
  - Ends the blizzard.
  - Revives mountain ecology.
  - Unlocks further regional content (frog choir, Gorman races).

---

## Adjacent Context for Other Prompts (Meta‑Game Info)

- Snowhead Temple is required for:
  - Completing Anju & Kafei quest (due to regional time dependencies).
  - Collecting all masks.
  - Accessing all Stray Fairies for Great Fairy upgrades.

---

## Stray Fairy Locations (Overview Only)

- Total of **15 Stray Fairies**.
- Hidden in:
  - Ice blocks.
  - Bubble traps.
  - Ceiling alcoves.
  - Behind melting puzzles.
  - Enemy drops.

---

## Common Failure Points (For Troubleshooting Prompts)

- Misalignment of central pillar prevents upward traversal.
- Missing small keys or melting sequences in wrong order.
- Lack of magic for Fire Arrow use.
- Goht arena difficulty due to low stamina or poor magic jar pathfinding.

---

## Useful Knowledge for External Context / Prompt Injection

- Goron physics significantly affect dungeon solutions.
- Fire Arrows introduce multi-layer puzzle logic.
- Snowhead Temple strongly emphasizes verticality.
- Goht battle speed mechanics may confuse first-time players.
