# Gardening — Technical Reference (General)

## Overview

Gardening encompasses the cultivation of plants for food, aesthetics, habitat creation, or ecological benefit. It involves soil management, plant selection, watering practices, seasonal cycles, and integrated pest management.

---

## Core Concepts

### Soil Fundamentals

- **Soil Types:** Clay, loam, sand.
- **Key Properties:** pH level, nutrient content (N-P-K), organic matter.
- **Soil Amendments:** Compost, manure, peat, perlite.

### Plant Categories

- **Annuals:** Complete lifecycle in one season.
- **Perennials:** Regrow yearly.
- **Biennials:** Grow foliage year one, bloom year two.
- **Vegetables/Herbs:** Edible plants requiring full sun and nutrient-rich soil.

---

## Environmental Factors

### Light

- **Full Sun:** 6+ hours.
- **Partial Shade:** 3–6 hours.
- **Shade:** <3 hours.

### Water

- **Deep Watering:** Encourages strong root systems.
- **Irrigation Systems:** Drip, sprinklers, soaker hoses.
- **Overwatering Risks:** Root rot, fungal growth.

### Climate & Seasons

- **Hardiness Zones:** Used to determine plant survivability.
- **Seasonal Timing:** Spring planting, fall cleanup, winterizing.

---

## Tools & Equipment

- Hand trowel, pruning shears, gloves.
- Watering cans or hoses.
- Mulch for weed suppression and moisture retention.

---

## Garden Maintenance

### Fertilization

- **Macronutrients:** Nitrogen (leaf growth), phosphorus (root development), potassium (overall health).
- **Organic Options:** Compost tea, bone meal.

### Weeding

- Reduces competition for nutrients.
- Methods: Hand-pulling, mulching, hoeing.

### Pest & Disease Management

- **Pests:** Aphids, slugs, caterpillars.
- **Controls:** Neem oil, beneficial insects, physical barriers.
- **Diseases:** Powdery mildew, root rot.

---

## Planting Best Practices

- Space plants based on mature size.
- Rotate crops annually to avoid soil depletion.
- Test soil before fertilizing.

---

## Safety Considerations

- Use gloves to avoid skin irritation.
- Store tools properly.
- Avoid chemical misuse.
